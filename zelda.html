        <h2>What is This?</h2>
        <p>This is a remake of the first dungeon from The Legend of Zelda (1986) for the NES. It was done in Unity as the first project for EECS 494 at the University of Michigan,
            and features a new custom level.
        </p>
        <h2>How Did I Contribute?</h2>
        <p>Working with fellow student Lechen Zhang, the development cycle from start to finish was roughly 4 weeks. In the base game, I personally implemented player animations,
            enemies, the sword and bow, most of the enemy/item placement, and the core mechanic for the custom level.
        </p>

        <h2>How Was it Made?</h2>
        <p>This remake is built on Unity and C#. This modern language offers many key features that were not available to the original programmers of the game, and allows us to take the game one step further in our custom level. Despite this, the game is meant to resemble the original as closely as possible, with authentic enemy behavior, graphics, sound effects, and other elements that mimic the original game's timeless design.
