    <h2>What is This?</h2>
      <p>This is an original game prototype made solo in roughly 3 weeks. It is not intended to be a full game experience, but rather a quick demo to explore some novel
        game design concepts and apply some beginner design practices.
      </p>
      <h2>How Was it Made?</h2>
      <p>This game is built on Unity and C#, which allowed for a very quick development cycle. I built the player's movement from the ground up, as I was not satisfied with
        the existing implementations for grappling hooks in Unity. Aside from the movement, the code was relatively simple, and allowed for a wide range of ideas to be explored
        in the level design without having to do too much programming.
        Aside from that, I also used Jira for project management, git for version control, and Aseprite for sprite creation/modification. Additionally, most of the art comes
        from <a href="https://opengameart.org">OpenGameArt</a>, a wonderful resource for free-to-use assets.
